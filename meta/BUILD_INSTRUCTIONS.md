# Execution Protocol: Strategic AI Consulting Site Build
# Context: Uses artifacts @PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md, @HUGO_CONFIG.md, and @CONTENT_STRATEGY.md

**Role:** You are a Senior Hugo Developer & Frontend Specialist.
**Goal:** execute the build of the website sequentially. Do not skip steps.

---

## STEP 1: Initialization & Theme
1. Initialize a new Hugo site in the current directory (force if necessary).
2. Install the **Blowfish** theme as a git submodule in `themes/blowfish`.
3. Remove the default `hugo.toml` generated by Hugo.
4. Create the necessary folder structure: `content/`, `assets/css/`, `layouts/`, `static/`.

## STEP 2: Configuration (The Brain)
1. Create a NEW `hugo.toml`.
2. Populate it strictly with the settings defined in **@HUGO_CONFIG.md**.
3. CRITICAL: Ensure `colorScheme = "blowfish"` and `background = "graph"` are set.
4. Configure the menu to have: "Home", "Services" (anchor to home), "About", "LinkedIn".

## STEP 3: The "Clean White" Styling (The Look)
1. Create `assets/css/custom.css`.
2. Add CSS variables or Tailwind overrides to enforce:
   - Background: Pure White (#ffffff).
   - Text: Dark Charcoal (#1f2937) for high contrast.
   - Canvas Opacity: Set the interactive background canvas opacity to `0.4` so it remains subtle.
   - Typography: Use a modern sans-serif stack (Inter, system-ui).

## STEP 4: Content Injection (The Meat)
1. Create `content/_index.md`.
   - Use the **Profile Layout**.
   - Insert the "Hero Headline" from **@CONTENT_STRATEGY.md**.
   - Use the `{{< card >}}` shortcodes to build the "Power Three" services section.
   - Use the `{{< chart >}}` shortcode to visualize the expertise radar chart.
2. Create `content/about.md`.
   - Insert the "About Me" narrative from **@CONTENT_STRATEGY.md**.
   - Ensure the Frontmatter includes `layout: "simple"` or "standard".

## STEP 5: Legacy & cleanup
1. Create `content/posts/archive/_index.md` with `title: "Archive"` and `build: {list: never}` so it doesn't clutter the main menu.
2. Create a placeholder post `content/posts/archive/legacy-post.md` to verify the structure works.
