Many AI consultants offer theory. I offer production-grade reality.

With a **Master of Science in Economics**, I view every algorithm through the lens of marginal utility and ROI.
As **Head of Data Science at Vodafone**, I navigate the complexities of legacy IT, governance, and organizational politics daily.

I don't sell software. I sell clarity. My goal is to help German Mittelstand and Enterprise companies turn 'AI Initiatives' into profitable business processes.
