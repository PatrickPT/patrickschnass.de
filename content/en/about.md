## Hi, I'm Patrick

I'm a technologist at heart with a passion for artificial intelligence, data science, and lifelong learning.

Currently, I lead the **Data Science department at Vodafone**, where my team and I apply machine learning and AI to create solutions that drive business value and enhance customer experiences. My role allows me to bridge the gap between AI research and real-world applications, ensuring that our models don't just live in Jupyter notebooks but actively contribute to decision-making, automation, and optimization.

With a **Master of Science in Economics**, I view every algorithm through the lens of marginal utility and ROI. I don't sell software. I sell clarity.

## Education

**Master of Science in Economics**

My economics background gives me a unique perspective on AI — I evaluate every model through the lens of marginal utility, cost-benefit analysis, and business ROI.

## Philosophy

Beyond my professional work, I am deeply committed to learning and sharing knowledge. I write about AI because I believe that the more we talk about these technologies, the more people can leverage them to participate.

Whether it's through my blog or collaborating with peers, I find joy in diving into complex topics and making them accessible and engaging for others.

On a personal note, I'm a father of two, an avid cyclist, and someone who enjoys pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I believe that continuous learning and personal growth are key in a rapidly evolving field like AI.
