## Hi, I'm Patrick

I'm a technologist at heart with a passion for artificial intelligence, data science, and lifelong learning.

Currently, I lead the **Data Science department at Vodafone**, where my team and I apply machine learning and AI to create solutions that drive business value and enhance customer experiences. My role allows me to bridge the gap between AI research and real-world applications, ensuring that our models don't just live in Jupyter notebooks but actively contribute to decision-making, automation, and optimization.

## Philosophy

On a personal note, I'm a father of two, an avid cyclist, and someone who enjoys pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I believe that continuous learning and personal growth are key in a rapidly evolving field like AI.
